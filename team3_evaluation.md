My observations:
  - Problem formulation: good enough.
  - Data clearning: goog enough
  - EDA: word count vs ... , correlation etc : Not bad
  - Mahine Learning: LSTM is implemented : Good but it is not clear that why they decided to use LSTM. some language model could have been better.
  - Presentation of data: Good
  - Presentation: Good
  - Learning: Not bad
